Anoynous is an Android application that servers as a blood bank. It connects people who need blood donations with people who can donate blood, to tackle the issue of lack of blood donors in the Egyptian Society.

This code is a sample pp, created by the instructors at STP '16 as an example for students at the workshop to understand the structure of an Android app and guide them throughout the process of building their own first app. The client side is developed in Android and the backend is developed using Facebook's (now deprecated) backend Parse engine.

Main developers:
1. Laila Maher
2. Mohammad Moneer Elhariry
